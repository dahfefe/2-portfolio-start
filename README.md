# <Felix: Portfolio>

## Description

As a up-and-coming web developer, I want to create a personal project portfolio which is accessible and public online so that future employers and clients can review my work and experience for potential hire. 

This is the beginning development of creating my personal portfolio of coding and web development projects that will eventually showcase my work to potential employers. 

My main purpose in creating this initial portfolio is fundamental as most (if not all) web developers need a website to display their personal work, experience, and biography to other companies who may want to employ them for their potential value. 

After completing this initial version of my coding portfolio, I learned a great deal about writing such a project from scratch and learning how all components of HTML and CSS truly entangle and work together to allow structure and design to display on webpages. The experience was immensely critical in helping me understand the true fundamentals in learning HTML and CSS functionality from the ground up and, more critically, in dealing with the repeated bugs and struggles that web developers undergo when writing code. 

## Usage

The main case uses for this project include the following:
1) utilizing the navigation bar in the header section to navigate to the designated sections of the webpage
2) clicking on images on the main body the page to navigate to specified project links to review my own personal projects completed by me
3) utilizing the links in the navigation bar of the footer section for contact me information 

Below are screenshots of each section of the project:
Header + "About Me" section:
